This project is about the Mass rapid transit system of Dhaka Metro Rail. A special toolkit of C++ named GLUT was used to create this project. We made roads with moving cars, tall and short buildings, and a metro rail. There's a sun and a moon in the sky, and fluffy clouds that move. Birds fly around too!
